# Building a Personal Professional Website

Building a professional website that will be linked to another website.
I will be using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website as we go


## Code Explanation
Use any text editor, open a new file and save your new file as name.html, where name is any file name you have chosen.
The first line of your code should be <!DOCTYPE html> which tells the browser what to expect and the html version. Currently, it's html5.
Follow this by html opening and closing html <html></html>
